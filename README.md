# Age Verifier

The Age Verifier is a simple application that determines gender and age range based on the provided year of birth. The application displays a randomly chosen image corresponding to the detected gender and age range.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joseook/age-verifier.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Enter the year of birth and select the gender.

4. Click the "Verify" button to calculate the age and display the result.

## Input Checks

The application performs checks on the input fields to ensure that the entered data is valid:

- **Year of Birth:**
  - Should be a number.

If the entered data does not meet these criteria, an alert will be displayed to provide feedback to the user.

## Style

The project uses CSS styles for a pleasant and responsive appearance. Images are randomly selected based on the detected gender and age range.
